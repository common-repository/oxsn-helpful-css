This plugin helps quickly add custom and responsive css classes.


== Description ==

This plugin is meant to help add helpful and responsive css classes. It is recommended that you use some sort of css minifier/combiner because this plugin uses a lot of css files.

Using this plugin is simple..

1. First, go to the customizer and enable which css classes you'd like to use by checking the appropriate checkboxes.
1. Second, you use your new classes!

Ex: If you checked the box to be able to do the class "Display Block" then you could use it by adding the class oxsn_xs_display_block.

The four responsive elements to the classes are xs, sm, md, lg.

*   xs displays when the screen is less than 768px
*   sm displays when the screen is greater than 768px
*   md displays when the screen is greater than 992px
*   lg displays when the screen is greater than 1200px
